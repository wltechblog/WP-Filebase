WP-Filebase Download Manager
===============================

This plugin was abandoned by its author many years ago, and is no longer compatible with modern php and wordpress. This repository is an uplift of it that should work with existing installations, with the exception of sites using the ID3 media metadata support.. The library providing that interface is also abandoned, so that functionality is removed. if you've been hanging on to php7 to support a customer who relies on this plugin, this should be just what you need.

The original readme follows.



WP-Filebase (free). This is basically the same version as the one in WordPress [Plugin Directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-filebase).
Sometimes fixes are published here first.
