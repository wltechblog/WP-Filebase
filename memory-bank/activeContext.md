## Active Decisions

### Security First
Security is a primary concern, with recent efforts focused on addressing potential vulnerabilities like XSS. All new code and changes are evaluated for security implications.

### Backward Compatibility
Maintaining compatibility with existing installations is important. Changes are made with consideration for users who have customized templates or rely on specific plugin behaviors.

### Performance Optimization
For sites with large file collections, performance is critical. Optimizations focus on reducing database queries, efficient file handling, and responsive UI.

### User Experience
Improvements to the admin interface aim to make file management more intuitive and efficient, with better feedback for user actions.

## Current Challenges

### Cloud Integration
Supporting various cloud storage providers while maintaining a consistent user experience presents ongoing challenges.

### Modern WordPress Compatibility
Ensuring compatibility with Gutenberg and other modern WordPress features while maintaining support for classic editor workflows.

### Mobile Experience
Improving the mobile experience for both administrators and end-users accessing file repositories.

### Large File Handling
Optimizing the handling of very large files and large collections of files without overwhelming server resources.

## Next Steps

Short-term priorities include:
1. Addressing any remaining security concerns
2. Fixing reported bugs in the file browser and upload functionality
